1) My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
This isn’t necessarily a programming skill but more just a general life skill and that is that sometimes the quick solution presents larger issues. Especially in programming, I tried to substitute in code from someone else and that caused so many more issues because I didn’t know how the code worked. The main portion of the assignment (taking the quantity available from the products.js page) I decided to use code from someone else because I didn’t really know how to do it. That really messed me up and I ended up turning in the assignment late and not finishing. So, the shortcut that I thought would help me, ended up being the reason I couldn’t finish. I’m not sure what would have happened if I tried to code on my own, but I do think my issues could have been solved with help from the professor since my code would’ve been simpler. I did learn some basic debugging skills which were helpful, but I think the main lesson I learned was just to suck it up and try to do it on my own, then use the professor if I can’t do it. Not to say I won’t ever use code from someone else, but I’m only going to use that as a last resort if I really can’t figure it out and what the professor is saying doesn’t make sense to me. I do want to work on my debugging skills since they are still very elementary. If I’m totally honest they are almost nonexistent so that is definitely something I’ve been trying to improve. I also think looking at the labs has really helped me get at least a skeleton for the Assignment work. For Assignment 2 I’ve been using the code from Lab 14 to make the bones of the login page. I know I have a lot more to do so I’ve been trying to look again at the labs and lectures to help myself visualize what to do, but at least for now my login page does work. I’m now trying to connect it to my store page but haven’t had time due to an ill timed trip to the mainland for visa application. However, Lab 14 has provided a great resource to at least get started on my Assignment 2. 
2) I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
As I said prior, I need to improve my debugging skills. I think that is the only definable skill that I can think of that I need to improve on. Obviously overall I just want to know how to program but that’s not a specific skill. I think debugging is like brushing your teeth, it’s not particularly cool and it’s something that you just need to do that takes time. But, if you do it correctly and are patient, results will show. I’ve tried going back and rewatching the debugging screencast, but I haven’t had to use the debugging skills in practice too heavily yet. My code is still very simple so things aren’t too complicated. My issue has always been application and critical thinking of how to extend and problem solve. I do believe some people can innately work through problems (high IQ) but I do know that problem solving can be learned. Right now, working through Assignment 2, I’ve been trying to do more of my own problem solving than in Assignment 1, and it’s a lot more viable because I’m actually using my own code (or more accurately code from the professor that I actually understand) to finish my assignment, only looking at other’s code when I’m really stuck (I haven’t gotten that desperate yet). 
3) I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
I think I understand the concepts behind the WODs, but I wouldn’t actually be able to code everything based on my conceptual understanding. For example, if I had to do all of the WODs in one sitting, I probably wouldn’t be able to do it. I might get 25% of the code correct, but I would probably be able to explain the concepts behind the code. However, I did learn a lot from the WODs. Just because I can’t completely code everything from the WODs doesn’t mean I didn’t learn from them. Once again, I can explain the concepts behind it, like where and how to use a certain kind of loop. That’s more important because you can learn the code and what to put, but it really helps to understand what I’m doing wrong or right when I’m stuck so I can ask the professor what I’m doing wrong. I actually did try to go back and complete WOD 1 with no outside help from memory just to see if I could do it and I think I got about 70% of the way done. But that was the easiest WOD and I spent the most time on that one (I didn’t realize that CTRL + r didn’t load all of the formatting from my css page when changes were made so I spent I think a few days trying to figure it out) so it makes sense that I was able to complete that much of it even after all this time. 
4)The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
Once again, from a conceptual standpoint, I think the Labs have helped me a lot. Doing the actual coding and knowing exactly what to put is obviously not my skill set because I wasn’t able to complete Assignment 1 on my own. But, the Labs did help me to kind of understand what I was doing and make sure I was on the right track. So for the coding part of the Labs, I think once again I’d only get a fraction of the coding correct. But I think for the conceptual questions that ask about the code, I would be able to answer them decently well I think. Looking back at my old labs, I might not understand every single line of code, but I do know the conceptual questions like “why use a for loop here” or “what are the advantages of using a loop” (those are easy questions but my point still stands). To me, that’s the important part because conceptual knowledge is what is important in critical thinking. I understand most of what is happening, even if the code is not in my brain to accompany that. I looked back at the lab about loops to make sure I knew how to do them. The structure of the loop is pretty simple and I could answer all of the conceptual questions, but on the lab on functions was conceptually a bit harder for me since there are different kinds of functions (although most share the same structure) so the code for them was harder for me to understand. W3 schools helps a lot with that but just looking at the labs I had a bit of trouble.
5)I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
I’d say another big takeaway from Assignment 1 was to start early. I was already behind since I had to work on my Assignment 1, and then I had to take a trip to San Francisco for my Visa for my study abroad to Copenhagen next semester, so that was a big setback. I’ve already started thinking about the Assignment already and have begun to get the structure of my Assignment 2 from Lab 14. I talked about this earlier but using code that I understand 100% is an equally large takeaway. I thought it would be easier to take code when I was stuck from someone else as a quick fix. But the early work on Assignment 2, despite being a bit more tedious since I’m not just cutting and pasting, is going to be a lot better for me in the long run since if I do have any questions on my code that I can’t figure out, I’ll understand what’s not working and can hopefully debug on my own or ask the professor a much more targeted question. 
6) I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
I think maybe pacing the course a bit better? I felt like things ramped up exponentially from the beginning of the semester to the end. I think if the earlier part of the course were paced a bit quicker, the ending of the course would allow more time for the work on the Assignments? I think personally, I would’ve liked having some extra time on the more technical aspects of the assignments later in the semester, rather than spending time on css and stylesheets earlier (since that is also covered in the WODs). That way, I think people would have more time to focus on the more important parts of the class, such as making our own website. On the subject of WODs, maybe more WODs per lab? Since WODs are just an extension of what is being done in class, but more self directed, I would have liked to have more examples of what to do to maybe help with debugging (I also think maybe having more debugging practice could be helpful to again just have more examples of what to do where and more effective debugging practices). But these are much more self directed than something that should be fixed in class itself. I think there are a lot of aids in class, but maybe having a Google Drive folder with all of the recordings of the labs just for convenience purposes? I sometimes had trouble locating the emails that had the link to the videos so having a Drive Folder with all of the videos would be a bit more helpful. Other than that, I think the class is structured the best way it can be given the time constraints. 
7) What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
One on one help and the screencasts of the Labs are the most useful aids for me. Being able to watch the labs back and hear the reasoning behind them, while also being able to pause or rewind if I need to, helps me to understand. I’m just a bit slower with this material so having the ability to watch lectures on my own time is really helpful. For Assignment 2 in particular, being able to watch back and hear the reasoning for the login page was so helpful because the professor was going line by line, explaining what he was doing, and I was able to rewind and slow things down, as well as view his code while he was doing it, which made it a lot easier on me when coding and making sure my code worked at each checkpoint. That’s a big issue for me is knowing where a good checkpoint is, mainly when I don’t understand the code. But in screencasts of the labs, it’s so helpful to see what is actually going on and then to have the professor test his code and be right alongside him doing the same thing. Then there’s one on one help which is basically like the lectures but more personal. I think most people would find one on one help the most valuable, but for me I like hearing other student’s questions as well because sometimes I might have that same issue. Then for my own understanding, it helps to hear the professor address my specific issue. I know it’s selfish but that’s the truth. But I think overall, what I think helps the most people overall is the recordings of the lectures, since everyone has access to them and you don’t need to ask for the lectures in particular. But obviously, if you need help and can’t figure out how what your issue is, then one on one help with the professor is hard to match since the professor may be able to spot something you aren't seeing.
