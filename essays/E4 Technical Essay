My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
This isn’t necessarily a programming skill but more just a general life skill and that is that sometimes the quick solution presents larger issues. Especially in programming, I tried to substitute in code from someone else and that caused so many more issues because I didn’t know how the code worked. The main portion of the assignment (taking the quantity available from the products.js page) I decided to use code from someone else because I didn’t really know how to do it. That really messed me up and I ended up turning in the assignment late and not finishing. So, the shortcut that I thought would help me, ended up being the reason I couldn’t finish. I’m not sure what would have happened if I tried to code on my own, but I do think my issues could have been solved with help from the professor since my code would’ve been simpler. I did learn some basic debugging skills which were helpful, but I think the main lesson I learned was just to suck it up and try to do it on my own, then use the professor if I can’t do it. Not to say I won’t ever use code from someone else, but I’m only going to use that as a last resort if I really can’t figure it out and what the professor is saying doesn’t make sense to me. I do want to work on my debugging skills since they are still very elementary. If I’m totally honest they are almost nonexistent so that is definitely something I’ve been trying to improve. 
I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
As I said prior, I need to improve my debugging skills. I think that is the only definable skill that I can think of that I need to improve on. Obviously overall I just want to know how to program but that’s not a specific skill. I think debugging is like brushing your teeth, it’s not particularly cool and it’s something that you just need to do that takes time. But, if you do it correctly and are patient, results will show. I’ve tried going back and rewatching the debugging screencast, but I haven’t had to use the debugging skills in practice too heavily yet. My code is still very simple so things aren’t too complicated. 
I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
I think I understand the concepts behind the WODs, but I wouldn’t actually be able to code everything based on my conceptual understanding. For example, if I had to do all of the WODs in one sitting, I probably wouldn’t be able to do it. I might get 25% of the code correct, but I would probably be able to explain the concepts behind the code. However, I did learn a lot from the WODs. Just because I can’t completely code everything from the WODs doesn’t mean I didn’t learn from them. Once again, I can explain the concepts behind it, like where and how to use a certain kind of loop. That’s more important because you can learn the code and what to put, but it really helps to understand what I’m doing wrong or right when I’m stuck so I can ask the professor what I’m doing wrong. 
The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
Once again, from a conceptual standpoint, I think the Labs have helped me a lot. Doing the actual coding and knowing exactly what to put is obviously not my skill set because I wasn’t able to complete Assignment 1 on my own. But, the Labs did help me to kind of understand what I was doing and make sure I was on the right track. So for the coding part of the Labs, I think once again I’d only get a fraction of the coding correct. But I think for the conceptual questions that ask about the code, I would be able to answer them decently well I think. 
I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
I’d say another big takeaway from Assignment 1 was to start early. I was already behind since I had to work on my Assignment 1, and then I had to take a trip to San Francisco for my Visa for my study abroad to Copenhagen next semester, so that was a big setback. I’ve already started thinking about the Assignment already and have begun to get the structure of my Assignment 2. 
I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
I think maybe pacing the course a bit better? I felt like things ramped up exponentially from the beginning of the semester to the end. I think if the earlier part of the course were paced a bit quicker, the ending of the course would allow more time for the work on the Assignments? That way, I think people would have more time to focus on the more important parts of the class, such as making our own website. I think there are a lot of aids in class, but maybe having a Google Drive folder with all of the recordings of the labs just for convenience purposes? Other than that, I think the class is structured the best way it can be given the time constraints. 
What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
By far one on one help and screencasts of labs.
