Rick Kazman is a Professor at the University of Hawaii and a Visiting Researcher at the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University.  His primary research 
interests are software architecture, design and analysis tools, software visualization, and software engineering economics. Kazman has been involved in the creation of 
several highly influential methods and tools for architecture analysis, including the ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method), the CBAM (Cost-Benefit Analysis Method) 
and the Dali and Titan tools.  He is the author of over 250 publications, co-author of three patents and eight books, including Software Architecture in Practice, Technical 
Debt: How to Find It and Fix It, Designing Software Architectures: A Practical Approach, Evaluating Software Architectures: Methods and Case Studies, and Ultra-Large-Scale 
Systems: The Software Challenge of the Future.   His research has been cited over 25,000 times, according to Google Scholar. He is currently the  chair of the IEEE TAC 
(Technical Activities Committee), Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering and member of the ICSE Steering Committee.

Kazman received a B.A. (English/Music) and M.Math (Computer Science) from the University of Waterloo, an M.A. (English) from York University, and a Ph.D. (Computational 
Linguistics) from Carnegie Mellon University.   How he ever became a software engineering researcher is anybodyâ€™s guess.  When not architecting or writing about architecture, 
Kazman may be found cycling, singing acapella music, playing the piano, practicing Tae Kwon Do, or (more often) flying back and forth between Hawaii and Pittsburgh.
